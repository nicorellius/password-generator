Make robust secrets with random characters, words, or
numbers, using Random.org's system for mostly random
strings and numbers.

Choose number of dice and how many times to roll to
create passphrases of common words. Number of rolls
determines how many words in your passphrase. Number
of dice determine which EFF word list to use: long
or short. Defaults to 5 dice and 5 rolls for words
type.

Mixed and numbers type don't use dice, but instead use
length. Defaults to 20. Longer passwords are better.
